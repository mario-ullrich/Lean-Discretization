"""Check that every declaration the blueprint cites exists in the compiled project.

Every ``\\lean{Decl}`` tag in ``blueprint/src/content.tex`` names a Lean
declaration, and so does every ``\\texttt{...}`` in the running text whose content
is a dotted name such as ``Discretization.gram``; the link script turns the latter
into links as well.  This script collects both kinds of names, writes a Lean file that imports
the root module of each library of the project, and asks Lean whether the
resulting environment contains each name.  A blueprint citing a declaration that
the project no longer has is wrong, so a missing name fails the run.

The check runs inside Lean itself, through ``lake env lean``, and therefore sees
exactly the environment the build produced.  It is the check that
``leanblueprint checkdecls`` performs, done without the ``checkdecls``
executable: that executable links Lake, and loading a project that imports Lake
a second time, as Mathlib does through ``importGraph``, is rejected by recent
Lean versions.

Run it from the project root after ``lake build``::

    python blueprint/scripts/check_lean_decls.py

Exits non-zero if no ``\\lean`` tag is found, or if any cited name is missing.
