"""Put the statements of the dependency graph into a fixed order.

plastexdepgraph writes the nodes and edges of the dependency graph in the iteration order
of Python sets, and that order changes from one run to the next, because Python hashes
strings with a random seed per process.  Graphviz lays a graph out partly according to the
order of its statements, so the same blueprint gave mirrored pictures in consecutive
builds.  This script sorts the node statements by name, in descending order, and the edge
statements by their endpoints, so that the graph source, and with it the picture, depends
only on the blueprint.  Either direction gives a fixed picture; the descending one is the
one whose layout was chosen for this blueprint.

The graph source is the DOT text that the page passes to `renderDot`.  The default
statements for the graph, the nodes and the edges stay in front and subgraphs at the end,
each in their original order.

Usage: python blueprint/scripts/sort_dep_graph.py [PAGE]
with PAGE defaulting to blueprint/web/dep_graph_document.html.
